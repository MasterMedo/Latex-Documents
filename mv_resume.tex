\section{ABOUT ME}
I am a long time {\bfseries Vim} and {\bfseries Arch Linux} user with a strong passion for problem solving.
My interests lie in technology, parallelisation, solution development and scalable systems.
Be it programming puzzles or production-ready applications I have a strong sense of ownership.
I tend to thrive under pressure, as tight deadlines make me more diligent.
Compared to peers I can be rash in the heat of the moment.
I belive in kindness and transparency.
