\section{ABOUT ME}
I spend most of my time in {\bfseries Neovim} and {\bfseries Arch Linux} problem solving and programming.
My daily activities include programming, tutoring mathematics and coding to several students and running.
I tend to thrive under pressure, as tight deadlines make me more diligent.
Compared to peers I can be rash in the heat of the moment.
I belive in kindness and transparency.
