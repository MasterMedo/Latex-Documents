\section{ABOUT ME}
I'm an extroverted and curious individual in search of conscientious people.
I enjoy improving, optimizing and creating.
My daily activities include running, exercising, tutoring math and programming to several students, cooking and a bit of problem solving or coding.
My side hobbies include building vocabulary, reading, writing, and playing board games.
I tend to thrive under pressure, as tight deadlines make me more diligent.
Compared to peers I can be rash in the heat of the moment.
When faced with a hard problem my brain tries to reformulate the question in a better-known domain which often wastes time, but certainly is amusing.
